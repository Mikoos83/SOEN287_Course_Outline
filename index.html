      <h3>Course Objectives and Content</h3>
      <p>This is an introductory course to Web programming.</p>
      <p>
        The course will include discussions and explanations of the following
        topics: Internet architecture and protocols; Web applications through
        clients and servers; markup languages; client-side programming using

        through server-side programming; preserving state in Web applications.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please notice that Web programming and Web application is a very wide
        domain. Many techniques are used to build a complex online business
        system. The following topics are NOT covered in this course, but in some
        other courses:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>J2EE, JSP, Servlet, (SOEN387), Web services (SOEN 487)</li>

      </p>
      <p>CLO 1. Have gained factual knowledge on Web site development</p>
      <p>

    <div>
      <h3>CEAB Attribute Assessment</h3>
      <p>
        As part of either the Computer Science or Software Engineering program
        curriculum, the content of this course includes material and exercises
        related to the teaching and evaluation of graduate attributes. Graduate
        attributes are skills that have been identified by the Canadian
        Engineering Accreditation Board (CEAB) and the Canadian Information
        Processing Society (CIPS) as being central to the formation of
        Engineers, computer scientists and information technology professionals
      </p>
      <p>
        As such, the accreditation criteria for the Software Engineering and
        Computer Science programs dictate that graduate attributes are taught
        and evaluated as part of the courses. The following is the list of
        graduate attributes covered in SOEN 287, along with a description of how
        these attributes are incorporated in the course:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Knowledge-base: Internet architecture and protocols. Web applications
          through clients and servers. Markup languages. Client-side programming
          using scripting languages. Static website contents and dynamic page
          generation through server-side programming. Preserving state
          (client-side) in web applications. (CLO 1)
        </li>
        <li>
          Use of Engineering tools: Use of appropriate software development
          tools and languages to develop web applications both on client and
          server side. (CLO 3)
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Evaluation Scheme</h3>
      <table>
        <tr>
          <td>Project</td>
          <td>20%</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>

        </tr>
      </table>
      <ol>
        <li>
          In order to pass the course, you must pass the term test and the final
          exam by getting over 50% of the marks in each one of them, regardless
          of your grade in other required components.
        </li>
        <li>
          There is no standard relationship between percentages and letter
          grades assigned.
        </li>
        <li>
          Although we encourage discussion of the project among students and
          groups, you should be aware of the University regulations concerning
          plagiarism described in 16.3.13 of the undergraduate Calendar. All
          students should become familiar with the University’s Code of Conduct
          located at
          http://www.concordia.ca/students/academic-integrity/code.html. In
          cases where cheating or plagiarism is suspected, the case will be
          forwarded directly to the appropriate university office for
          consideration. Please do not assume that you get “second chances” when
          it comes to cheating. Once is often enough to damage your academic
          career.

      <h3>How to study in this course:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          If certain concepts are unclear to you, seek help right away. Ask your
          TA during the tutorial and/or your instructor for help. Make use of
          your instructor’s office hours; book an appointment with your
          instructor if the office hours are not suitable.
        </li>
        <li>
          Programming is not a “spectator sport”. You need to get your hands
          dirty by trying the examples discussed in class as well as look for
          other examples online and/or in textbooks.
        </li>
      </ul>
